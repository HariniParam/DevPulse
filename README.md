   ```

2. Create virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure `.env` with your MongoDB URI:
   ```env
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/devpulse
   SECRET_KEY=your-django-secret
   ```
